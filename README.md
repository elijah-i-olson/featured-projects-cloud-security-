# ☁️ Cloud Security Projects

Welcome to my collection of cloud security projects that showcase my skills in:

- Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
- Cloud architecture (Azure-focused)
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Regulatory alignment (FedRAMP, NIST, PCI DSS)
- Post-incident remediation and business continuity

These projects reflect real-world scenarios designed to demonstrate both technical and strategic decision-making in securing cloud environments.

## 🔐 Featured Project: Rebuilding Trust in the Cloud

**Objective:**  
Simulate the post-incident remediation of a cloud environment after the departure of a privileged insider — with a focus on regulatory alignment, IAM, and secure cloud design.

**Key Highlights:**
- ✅ Corrected RBAC misconfigurations in Azure
- 🔒 Hardened IAM using Zero Trust and Least Privilege
- 📁 Designed compliant backup & retention strategies
- 📜 Aligned infrastructure with NIST 800-53 & FedRAMP

## 📌 Why These Projects Matter

These cloud security exercises aren't just academic—they're practical blueprints for GRC professionals and cybersecurity practitioners tasked with protecting regulated, high-availability environments.

If you're interested in how to bridge the gap between **compliance** and **cloud technology**, these projects are for you.
